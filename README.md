# ESDM_G1_PROJECT

This repo is created for SECP3623 Project - Subject Registration Enhancement Module of the UTHM Case Study  

This project aims to design and develop an enterprise-level subsystem that supports university subject registration process.  The system improves course planning, reduces registration errors, and enhances communication between students and academic advisors. It applies Enterprise Architecture principles, integrates data across academic units, and uses modern technologies 
(database, web framework, and system modelling tools) to ensure a scalable and efficient academic management solution.

## 🗓️ Timeline of Activities 

| Date | Activity Description | Outcome |
|------|----------------------|---------|
| **10 Dec 2025** |  Discussed tasks for Chapter 1 and 2 and assigned work to 5 group members.  | Task distribution completed; target to finish both chapters by 24 Dec 2025. |
| **11 Dec 2025** |  Identified the entities, relationships, and data required for the Subject Registration Enhancement Module.  |  Initial data structure prepared; outputs to be reviewed with other groups to identify shared core tables.  |
| **13 Dec 2025** |  Sub-Module Assignment & Role Definition for Subject Registration Enhancement Module (Group 1).  | Team roles assigned to the 5 mandated sub-modules: Brendan (Course Catalogue Browser), Neo (Timetable Conflict Checker), Sabrina (Credit Hour Validator), Gui (Add/Drop Application Form), and Woo (Add/Drop Approval Workflow). |
| **14 Dec 2025** |  Team meeting via Google Meet to define the Entities, Relationships, and Data required for the Subject Registration Enhancement Module.  | Produced the first draft of the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) using online modeling tools, defining the core tables. |
| **17 Dec 2025** |  Project Scope and Member Role Reassignment: Combined the Course Catalogue and Add/Drop Application modules, and introduced a new administrative function.  | New roles assigned: Brendan (Course Registration & Application Portal), Neo (Timetable Conflict Checker), Sabrina (Credit Hour Validator), Woo (Add/Drop Approval Workflow), and Gui (Course Master Data Administrator). This requires updating the ERD and use cases. |
| **24 Dec 2025** |  In-Class Group Activity: Development of a conceptual Enterprise Architecture (EA) for the Subject Registration Enhancement Module.  | Produced a conceptual blueprint aligning Business, Application, Data, and Technology layers. Established the architectural reasoning for how the module integrates with existing UTHM subsystems (SMP/SMS). |
| **25 Dec 2025** |  Design Phase Planning: Scheduled the drawing and finalization phase for all core system diagrams.  | Established a deadline of Dec 30 to complete the group Enterprise Architecture (EA), Use Case Diagram, and Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). Confirmed individual requirements for each member to produce a Use Case Description and Sequence Diagram for their respective sub-modules. |
| **31 Dec 2025** |  Integration & Final Task Distribution: Combined the Group 1 EA diagram with other project modules to create a holistic "Big Picture" Enterprise Architecture.  | Established the interconnection between the Subject Registration module and other university systems. Finalized and distributed the workload for Chapters 3, 4, and 5 to all five members to ensure completion by Jan 12. |
| **7 Jan 2026** |  EA Virtual Presentation: Conducted a formal presentation of the Subject Registration Enhancement Module's Enterprise Architecture to the UTHM representative, Dr. Ts. Muhamad Rais bin Abd Halim.  | Received validation on the four-layer architectural alignment (Business, Application, Data, and Technology) and its integration with UTHM legacy systems. |
| **19 Jan 2026** |  Instruction Update: Received new project requirements to transition design from Figma into a functional SAP Build Apps prototype.  | Initiated technical migration of validation logic (Timetable Conflict and Credit Hour) into the SAP environment with a target deadline of Feb 13. |
| **23 Jan 2026** |  Final Submission: Submitted the comprehensive final report, including the high-fidelity Figma prototype and the video demo presentation, via the UTHM e-learning portal.  | Successfully documented the entire project lifecycle from problem identification to integrated design and prototype demonstration. |
